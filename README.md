# CVBRM


Computer Vision Based Route Mapping was my Senior Project. The project was an app that allows the user to draw or import an image, find paths within that image, and create a real world running or cycling route based on the chosen path. A location marker allowed the user to follow along the path. The app is no longer functional because we were using free services through Google which we no longer have access to. Therefore, all of the files containing private keys have been removed. All of the library files for OpenCV, which was used for edge detection, as well as the Android project files, which took up lots of space, have also been removed.

[CanvasView](app/src/main/java/edu/calpoly/cvbrm/CanvasView.java)

[ConfigActivity](app/src/main/java/edu/calpoly/cvbrm/ConfigActivity.java)

[MainActivity](app/src/main/java/edu/calpoly/cvbrm/MainActivity.java)
