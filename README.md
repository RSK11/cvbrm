Computer Vision Based Route Mapping was my Senior Project. The project was an app that allows the user to draw or import an image, find paths within that image, and create a real world running or cycling route based on the chosen path. A location marker allowed the user to follow along the path. All of the files containing private keys and information relating to our associated google account have been removed. All of the library files for OpenCV, which was used for edge detection, as well as the Android project files, which took up lots of space, have also been removed.
